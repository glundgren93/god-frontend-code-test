### vcc-ui actual usage

Trying using tabNav:
Error: The "useFela" hook can only be used inside a "RendererProvider"

We should throw a more descriptive message. Even though we use "useFela", this should be transparent to the user, as he shouldn't care/be aware of what we use.
A proper message would be: "To use TabNav component, you need to first set up a StyleProvider."

I didn't wrap ThemePicker, so this error showed up.

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ornament')

This error happened while generating the page. Any console logs will be displayed in the terminal window.

```
return {
      borderBottomColor: reverseOut ? theme.color.primitive.grey100 : theme.color.ornament.divider,
      backgroundColor: reverseOut ? theme.color.primitive.grey100 : theme.color.background.secondary
    };
```

Once again, I think we should improve error feedback. And we should actually check if we have a theme.
